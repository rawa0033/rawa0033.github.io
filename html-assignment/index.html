        <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey, I'm Rishabh Rawat, and I enjoy playing <strong><abbr title="First Person Shooter">FPS</abbr></strong> games like Valorant and Counter-Strike. Whether I'm grinding ranked battles or simply having fun with friends, gaming is an important part of my life. When I'm not gaming, I enjoy watching sitcoms such as <em>Friends</em>, <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>, <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>, and <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em>, which never fail to make me chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>I also really enjoy anime! Some of my favourites include <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Haikyuu!!</em>,<em>Black Clover</em>, and <em>Hunter x Hunter</em>. I enjoy the action, adventure, and fantastic characters in these series. Whether it's 1<sup>st</sup> volleyball match of karasono in Haikyuu!! or an epic battle in One Piece, I'm constantly captivated. My favourite activities are watching anime and playing video games.</p>
